/**
 * @file
 * Custom SASS variables - before Foundation.
 *
 * NOTE 1:
 * Don't try to override Foundation variables here at all.
 * If you want to modify Foundation variables, it's better to do it in
 * ./_sass-foundation-variables.scss.
 *
 * NOTE 2:
 * The variables defined here will be available to use in the Foundation
 * variables file, as this file is being included BEFORE that one.
