 * Custom SASS variables - after Foundation.
 *
 * NOTE 1:
 * Don't try to override Foundation variables here at all.
 * If you want to modify Foundation variables, it's better to do it in
 * ./_sass-foundation-variables.scss.
 *
 * NOTE 2:
 * You can use Foundation variables in this one, as this file is being
 * included AFTER the Foundation vars file.
