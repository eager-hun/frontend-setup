This is the url that generates the modernizr build that was used in this
project:

http://modernizr.com/download/?-backgroundsize-flexbox-inlinesvg-svg-domprefixes-setclasses-testallprops-testprop-teststyles-cssclassprefix:mdz-

Note that the last bit in the url, `:mdz-`, signifies the desired prefix for the
classes generated by modernizr. This argument doesn't seem to be working on the
modernizr website, so you might need to manually enter `mdz-` into the form
field.

To get it working,

1. save the build in this directory as modernizr-custom.js,
2. in .gulpfile.js, set `options.modernizr` to true,
3. then restart gulp (and refresh the browser, if neccessary).
